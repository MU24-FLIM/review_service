This is a school project made with IntelliJ Java, MySQL, Spring boot, REST API, CRUD and JPA.
A group project to build an application consisting of four separate micro services.
The project group:

- - Madeleine: Genres

To run this project you need to:
Clone all repositories.
Read the README of each project to find information about the services.
Set up the databases in MySQL.
Set up your environmental variables in each service (in the resource application.properties, youÂ´ll find names used for each parameter.).
Remember to include the different webclients for the different services.
Run each Java-application. They will create the necessary tables and mock data to start with.
Use Postman to test the API.
